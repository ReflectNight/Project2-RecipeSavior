hitting enter on search should search without me clicking submit

hitting new recipie should clear the current picture on the left

should have some bulelt point in the ingredient text box so the user knows the format to enter in ingredients

after creating recipie, i think it should automatically bring you to the most recently created recipie.

would be nice if you could upload photo of your own.

search no work, arrows no work :(

maybe add delete confirmation

how do you go back to the main page? is there a main page?

arrow keys no work?
unfortunate ingredient things overlap in search
