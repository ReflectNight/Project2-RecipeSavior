Pop in a movie while making the cake to help pass the time.\nThis recipe can easily be made for those who do not consume dairy by making sure the frosting and cake mix you use do not contain dairy. Which is easily done, I being dairy intolerant myself.\nAnd lastly, this cake is for fun. It is for the nerd in all of us that just wants to sit down with a bunch of friends, and eat. This cake is perfect for that. Heck, you could all bring food and call it a Lies and Deceit Pot Luck, and LAN your way through the meal!\nWarning to the wise: this cake is VERY rich. Don't cut it into eight slices, cut it into sixteen. Regular sized slices will just make people sick to their stomachs because of how rich this cake is. So do eat carefully.\nThe night before, mix 2/3c cocoa powder with 1.5 cans of vanilla frosting. Save the remaining half can of vanilla frosting for later.\nNext day: remove mixed frosting and vanilla frosting from the fridge and set to the side. Also place the cherries and chocolate chips to the side. They will not be used until the cake is completely done.\nPre-heat over to 375 degrees F.\nLightly butter two 9 inch cake pans.\nIn one bowl combine all remaining dry ingredients.\nIn larger bowl, combine all liquid ingredients and egg whites. Mix thoroughly.\nSlowly sift dry ingredients into the large bowl of liquid ingredients. Mix thoroughly.\nPour half of the batter into one prepared cake pan, and the rest into the second cake pan.\nCook for 30+ minutes, until a knife can be removed cleanly from the cake.\nWhen done cooking, allow the cake to cool for at least one hour.\nRemove top quarter inch from one cake round. Basically, let it have a completely flat top so that the second layer can rest smoothly on top. I suggest using a bread knife.\nUse the coconut frosting as the inner layer.\nPlace second layer on top of first layer.\nFrost with the cocoa powder mixed frosting. Warning: this stuff is stiff, so it takes a little work.\nCoat entire cake with chocolate chips, press them lightly into the frosting to get them to stay. The recipe suggests one cup, I would suggest just taking from the bag. Measurements are just suggestions for chocolate chips.\nUsing the remaining vanilla frosting and a tablespoon, dallop eight circles around the top of the cake.\nPlace the eight cherries on top of the eight vanilla frosting circles.\nTreat your friends to a meal of Lies and Deceit. ^.^.","imageURL":"http://food.sndimg.com/img/recipes/26/49/19/large/picZHrX5d.jpg"},{"title":"Chili Con Carne With Beans","ingredients":"2 lbs ground beef\n1 large onion, chopped\n2 garlic cloves, minced\n1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce\n1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste\n1 (15 ounce) can tomatoes\n1 (15 ounce) can diced tomatoes with green chilies\n1 (12 ounce) bottle dark beer\n1 teaspoon ground cumin\n1 teaspoon paprika\n2 teaspoons chili powder\n1 teaspoon oregano\n1 teaspoon salt\n1/2 teaspoon pepper\n1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce\n1 (28 ounce) can chili beans","directions":"Saute meat, onions and garlic until done.\nAdd remaining ingredients and simmer for 2 hours.\nThe beer is optional but does add a good flavor and, of course, the alcohol is cooked out during cooking.\n","imageURL":"http://food.sndimg.com/img/recipes/11/14/9/large/picVWlHJa.jpg"},{"title":"Lasagna","ingredients":"1 pound sweet Italian sausage\n 3/4 pound lean ground beef\n 1/2 cup minced onion\n 2 cloves garlic, crushed\n 1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes\n 2 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste\n 2 (6.5 ounce) cans canned tomato sauce\n 1/2 cup water\n 2 tablespoons white sugar\n 1 1/2 teaspoons dried basil leaves\n 1/2 teaspoon fennel seeds\n 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning\n 1 tablespoon salt\n 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper\n 4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley\n 12 lasagna noodles\n 16 ounces ricotta cheese\n 1 egg\n 1/2 teaspoon salt\n 3/4 pound mozzarella cheese, sliced\n 3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese","directions":"In a Dutch oven, cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium heat until well browned.
